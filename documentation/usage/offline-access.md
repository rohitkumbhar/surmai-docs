# Offline Access

## What is Offline Access?

Offline Access allows you to view and use your trip information in Surmai even when you don't have an internet
connection. This feature downloads all trip data and attachments to your device, making them available whenever you need
them, regardless of connectivity status.

## Benefits of Offline Access

- **Always available**: Access your trip details anytime, even in areas with poor or no network coverage
- **Faster loading**: View trip information instantly without waiting for data to download
- **Reduced data usage**: Save on mobile data costs when accessing previously downloaded trips
- **Travel reliability**: Ensure you have access to critical trip information while traveling

## Enabling Offline Access

Offline Access needs to be activated individually for each trip you want to access without an internet connection:

1. Navigate to the trip details page for the trip you want to make available offline
2. Open the **Basic Information** section
3. Click on the **Action** menu
4. Select **Enable Offline**
5. Wait for the download to complete (time varies based on trip size and connection speed)

The trip information and all attachments will be downloaded to your current device.

## Important Notes

- **Per-device setting**: Offline Access must be enabled separately on each device you plan to use
- **Manual updates**: Changes made to a trip are not automatically synced to offline devices
    - To update offline data, repeat the Enable Offline process to download the latest information
- **Storage requirements**: Ensure your device has sufficient storage space, especially for trips with many attachments
- **Troubleshooting**: If the download process fails, check your device's available storage and your internet connection

For the best experience, we recommend updating your offline trip data before traveling or whenever significant changes
have been made to your trip information.
