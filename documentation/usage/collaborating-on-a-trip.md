# Collaborating on a Trip

## What is Trip Collaboration?

Trip Collaboration allows multiple people to work together on planning a trip in Surmai. This feature keeps all trip information in one centralized location, making it easy for everyone involved to access and contribute to the planning process.

## Benefits of Collaboration

- **Centralized information**: All trip details are stored in one place, eliminating the need to forward emails
- **Chronological organization**: Information is presented in a logical, time-based order
- **Equal access**: All collaborators have the same level of access to trip details
- **Simplified planning**: Everyone can find and contribute to any aspect of the trip

## Inviting Collaborators

To invite others to collaborate on your trip:

1. Navigate to the trip details page
2. Open the **Basic Information** section
3. Click on the **Action** menu
3. Select **Collaborators**
4. Enter the email address of the person you wish to invite along with a brief message
5. The system will send an invitation that they can accept or decline

Once accepted, collaborators will have full access to view and edit all trip information.

## Important Notes

- **Administrator settings**: If email functionality is not enabled on your server, you will receive an invitation link instead of an automatic email
- **Sharing invitations**: Each invitation is unique to a specific email address and cannot be shared among multiple people
- **Access level**: All collaborators currently receive full access to the trip details
- **Invitation status**: Collaborators must accept the invitation before they can access the trip

For the best planning experience, invite all necessary collaborators early in the trip planning process to ensure everyone has access to the information they need.
