# Import and Export Trips

## What is Trip Import/Export?

The Import and Export features allow you to save trip data as files that can be backed up or transferred between Surmai servers. This functionality helps you preserve your trip information and share it across different installations.

## Exporting Trips

Exporting creates a complete backup of a trip in a portable format:

1. Navigate to the trip you want to export
2. Open the **Basic Information** section
3. Click on the **Actions** menu
4. Select **Export Trip**
5. Save the generated zip file to your preferred location

The exported zip file contains:
- A JSON file with all trip details (transportation, lodgings, activities)
- All original attachments associated with the trip

## Importing Trips

To add a previously exported trip to your Surmai server:

1. Go to the Home page
2. Click the **Import Trip** link
3. Select the zip file you want to import
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the import

## Common Uses

- **Backup**: Create archives of important trips for safekeeping
- **Transfer**: Move trip data between different Surmai installations
- **Sharing**: Provide trip information to other Surmai users

## Important Notes

- Exported files contain all trip information as of the export time
- Any changes made after exporting will not be reflected in the exported file
- Ensure you have sufficient storage space when importing trips with large attachments
