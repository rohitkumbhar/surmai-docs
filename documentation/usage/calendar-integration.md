# Calendar Integration

## What is Calendar Integration?

Calendar Integration in Surmai allows you to synchronize your trip details with your preferred calendar application. This feature exports your trip events in the standard iCalendar format (.ics), making it easy to view your travel plans alongside your other appointments and commitments.

## Benefits of Calendar Integration

- **Unified scheduling**: View all your travel plans alongside your regular calendar events
- **Offline access**: Access your trip schedule even without an internet connection
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works with most popular calendar applications including Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and others

## Exporting Your Trip to a Calendar

To add your trip to your calendar application:

1. Navigate to the trip details page
2. Open the **Basic Information** section
3. Click on the **Action** menu
4. Select **Add To Calendar**
5. Save the downloaded .ics file to your device
6. Import the file into your preferred calendar application

Most calendar applications will automatically detect and add all events from your trip when you open or import the .ics file.

## Timezone Considerations

For accurate scheduling across different time zones:

- **Associate destinations**: Link each transportation, lodging, or activity with its corresponding destination
- **Timezone accuracy**: Surmai uses the destination's timezone to create correctly timed calendar events
- **Local time display**: Events will appear in your calendar according to the local time at each destination

## Important Notes

- **Manual updates**: Changes to your trip in Surmai are not automatically synchronized with your calendar
  - Download a new .ics file and reimport it whenever you make significant changes to your trip
- **Calendar notifications**: Set up notifications in your calendar application for important events
- **Multiple calendars**: You can choose which calendar to import your trip events into within your calendar application
