## What is a Progressive Web Application (PWA)?

Surmai is available as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that can be installed on your mobile devices. PWAs are web
applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. They offer several advantages:

- **Offline functionality**: PWAs can work offline or with poor network connectivity
- **Fast loading**: They're optimized for speed and performance
- **Responsive design**: They work on any device with a supported browser
- **Regular updates**: Updates happen automatically when you're online
- **No app store required**: Install directly from your browser
- **Reduced storage space**: PWAs typically use less storage than native apps

## Installing Surmai on Your Mobile Device

Surmai is not available in traditional app stores. Instead, you can install it directly from your web browser by
following the platform-specific instructions below.

### Installing on Android Devices

1. Open Google Chrome or Samsung Internet browser on your Android device
2. Navigate to your Surmai server URL
3. If a prompt appears suggesting you add the app to your home screen, tap "Install" or "Add to Home Screen"

If no prompt appears automatically:

1. Tap the three-dot menu (⋮) in the upper right corner of Chrome
2. Select "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen"
3. Confirm by tapping "Install" or "Add"
4. The Surmai icon will appear on your home screen or app drawer

Some Android browsers may have slightly different steps:

- In Samsung Internet: Tap menu (≡) → "Add page to" → "Home screen"
- In Microsoft Edge: Tap menu (…) → "Add to Home screen"

### Installing on iPhone and iPad (iOS/iPadOS)

1. Open Safari browser on your iOS device (PWA installation is only supported in Safari)
2. Navigate to your Surmai server URL
3. Tap the Share button (rectangle with arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen
4. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
5. You can edit the name of the app if desired
6. Tap "Add" in the upper right corner
7. The Surmai icon will appear on your home screen

**Note**: On iOS, PWAs must be installed through Safari. Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers on iOS will not support the
full PWA installation process.

## Using the Surmai PWA

Once installed, the Surmai PWA will function much like a native app:

- It will have its own icon on your home screen
- It will open in full-screen mode without browser navigation controls
- It may support push notifications (if enabled)
- It can work offline or with limited connectivity for certain features

For the best experience, ensure your device is running a recent version of its operating system and browser.
