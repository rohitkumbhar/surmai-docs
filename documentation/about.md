# About Surmai

Surmai started as a very practical itch: planning family trips kept leaking across group chats, emails, spreadsheets,
and long forgotten notes. I wanted a unified place where all the moving parts of a journey could live together without 
turning travel into another project at work. That idea slowly became Surmai, a simple organizer that helps you and the 
people you travel with stay on the same page.

A few principles shape everything here. Your plans are yours, so Surmai is built to respect your privacy. It should work
even when the internet doesn’t, because airports, trains, and remote towns don’t always cooperate. And it should be
something you can understand and, if you like, run yourself. That’s why Surmai is open source.

This isn’t meant to replace the joy (and chaos) of planning, just to reduce the friction. Share an itinerary with a
partner, keep notes for a future trip, or map out a complex journey with multiple stops. The goal is to make travel
planning feel lighter and more collaborative without adding another account to babysit.

Surmai continues to evolve in small, thoughtful steps. If you’re curious, opinionated, or just tired of juggling travel
details across a dozen places, I hope you find it useful. And if you’d like to suggest something, or even run it
yourself, you’re more than welcome to be part of its path forward.
