# User Management

## Overview

The User Management interface is accessible via the "Users" section on the Settings page. This interface provides
administrative control over user accounts within the Surmai system.

## Available Functions

### User Creation

The system supports adding new users through an invitation mechanism. Administrators can generate invitations that allow
new users to establish accounts within the Surmai platform.

### Credential Management

Administrative functions include the ability to reset or modify authentication credentials for existing user accounts.
This functionality enables account recovery and security maintenance.

### Account Removal

The system supports permanent removal of user accounts from the database.



> [!CAUTION]
> Account deletion is irreversible and cascades to all associated data. When a user account is deleted, all
trips and trip-related data belonging to that user are also permanently removed from the system.
