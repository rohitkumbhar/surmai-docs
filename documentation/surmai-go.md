# Surmai Go

Surmai Go is the managed, cloud-hosted version of Surmai. It offers the exact same product experience as the self‑hosted
distribution, without the operational overhead of deploying and maintaining your own infrastructure.

- Create an account at https://go.surmai.app using your email address, or sign in with Google.
- No local installation or server management is required; updates, monitoring, and backups are handled for you.

## Key Capabilities

Surmai Go provides the full Surmai feature set, plus the benefits of a managed service:

- Zero-maintenance operations: automated updates and patches.
- Reliable infrastructure managed by the primary author of Surmai.
- Regular backups with point-in-time restoration upon request.
- Smooth migration path to a self-hosted deployment if you prefer to operate Surmai yourself.

## Privacy and Data Protection

We take privacy seriously and aim to be transparent about how your data is handled in Surmai Go.

- Administrative access: Authorized administrators of Surmai Go may access your data when required for operations,
  support, or compliance. Access follows the principle of least privilege.
- Third-party integrations: Surmai’s integration features do not expose your private data to third‑party applications
  unless explicitly configured by you.
- Communications: Your account email may be used to contact you with important service announcements and system-wide
  notifications.
- Data backups: Your data is backed up periodically and can be restored if necessary.
- Data requests: You can request data export or account deletion by contacting support.

## Security

- All access to Surmai Go is served over HTTPS.
- Data is stored using secure, industry‑standard practices.
- Access controls are enforced to protect customer accounts and data.

## Availability and Backups

Surmai Go infrastructure is monitored and maintained to provide a reliable service. Regular backups are performed, and
point‑in‑time restores can be initiated if recovery is needed.

## Pricing

Surmai Go is currently available at no cost. Pricing may be introduced in the future based on operating costs. If that
happens, you will receive ample prior notice, and you will always retain the option to migrate to
a [self‑hosted installation](/documentation/installation).

## Migration to Self-Hosted

Should you choose to run Surmai yourself, Surmai Go supports exporting your data so you can transition to a self‑hosted
deployment with minimal friction. Refer to the [installation guide](/documentation/installation) to get started.
