## Disclaimer

If you feel like the documentation reads like AI generated text, that is because it is. Pretty much most of the
documentation has been "revised" by AI using the Jetbrains Junie agent based on my initial writeup of every page of the
documentation. To it's credit, it has done a much better job of writing readable/understandable documentation than my
terse bullet points would have. I have read every word it generated and (hopefully) removed all the extra features that
it described but don't really exist quite yet.
